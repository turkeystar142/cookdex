## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** - Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. **Mix dry ingredients** - In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.

3. **Cream butter and sugars** - In a large bowl, beat softened butter with both sugars until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.

4. **Add eggs and vanilla** - Beat in eggs one at a time, then add vanilla extract.

5. **Combine mixtures** - Gradually stir in the flour mixture until just combined.

6. **Add chocolate chips** - Fold in the chocolate chips.

7. **Shape and bake** - Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 9-12 minutes or until golden brown.

8. **Cool** - Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.

## Tips

- Use room temperature butter for best results
- Don't overbake - cookies continue cooking after removal from oven
- For chewier cookies, slightly underbake them
- Store in an airtight container for up to 5 days
