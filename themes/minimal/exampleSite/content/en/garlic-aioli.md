## Ingredients

- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 2 egg yolks
- 1 tablespoon lemon juice
- 1 cup neutral oil (vegetable or light olive oil)
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- Pinch of white pepper

## Instructions

1. **Prepare garlic** - Mince the garlic very finely or use a garlic press.

2. **Mix base** - In a medium bowl, whisk together egg yolks, lemon juice, minced garlic, and salt.

3. **Add oil slowly** - While whisking constantly, add the oil in a very thin, steady stream. Start with just drops at first.

4. **Emulsify** - Continue whisking and adding oil until the mixture thickens and emulsifies into a creamy aioli.

5. **Season** - Taste and adjust salt and lemon juice as needed. Add white pepper.

6. **Chill** - Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow flavors to meld.

## Tips

- Use room temperature ingredients for better emulsification
- If the aioli breaks, start with a fresh egg yolk in a clean bowl and slowly whisk in the broken aioli
- Add oil very slowly at first to prevent breaking
- Store in the refrigerator for up to 1 week
- Try adding roasted garlic for a milder flavor
