## Ingredients

- 1 pound dried black beans, washed and sorted
- 1/2 green bell pepper, diced
- 1/2 onion, diced
- 3 garlic cloves, minced
- 1 teaspoon ground cumin
- 1 teaspoon dried oregano
- 2 bay leaves
- 1 tablespoon white vinegar
- 1 tablespoon white wine
- 1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)
- 6 green olives
- 1 aji cachucha pepper (optional)
- Water to cover

## Instructions

1. **Soak the beans** - Rinse the beans thoroughly and soak in water for 2 hours. Drain and rinse again.

2. **Combine ingredients** - Place beans in a large pot with all remaining ingredients. Add enough water to cover the beans by about 2 inches.

3. **Bring to boil** - Bring the pot to a boil over high heat, stirring occasionally.

4. **Simmer** - Reduce heat to low and simmer for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Add more water if needed to keep beans covered.

5. **Check for doneness** - Beans are done when they're soft and tender, and the cooking liquid has thickened into a flavorful broth.

6. **Adjust seasoning** - Taste and add more salt if needed.

## Tips

- Don't salt the beans too early as it can make them tough
- The longer the beans cook, the more flavorful they become
- Serve over white rice for a traditional Cuban meal
- Leftovers taste even better the next day
- Freeze in portions for easy weeknight meals
