## Creating Screenshots

To create these screenshots:

2. Open the site in a browser
3. Take a full-page screenshot showing:
   - Header with site title and mascots
   - Recipe card grid
   - Search and filter interface
4. Resize and save as `screenshot.png`
5. Create a smaller version as `tn.png`

## Example Content

Make sure your site has example content that shows off the theme's features:

- Different categories (meal, snack, topping, drink)
- Various tags (sweet, savory, sour, different cooking methods)
- Both languages if multilingual

Place the screenshot files directly in this directory (`themes/cookdex/images/`).
