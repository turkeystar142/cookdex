## Ingredients

### For the Cupcakes
- 1½ cups all-purpose flour
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ cup unsalted butter, softened
- 1 cup sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- ½ cup whole milk

### For the Strawberry Frosting
- 1 cup unsalted butter, softened
- 4 cups powdered sugar
- ¼ cup strawberry puree
- Pink food coloring (optional)
- Fresh strawberries for garnish

## Instructions

### Making the Cupcakes

1. Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with cupcake liners.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.

3. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy, about 3-4 minutes.

4. Add eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition. Mix in vanilla extract.

5. Add flour mixture in three parts, alternating with milk, beginning and ending with flour. Mix until just combined.

6. Divide batter evenly among cupcake liners, filling each about ⅔ full.

7. Bake for 18-20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.

8. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

### Making the Frosting

1. Beat butter until smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes.

2. Gradually add powdered sugar, one cup at a time, beating well after each addition.

3. Add strawberry puree and mix until smooth and fluffy.

4. If desired, add a drop or two of pink food coloring for a prettier pink color.

5. Pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes using your favorite tip.

6. Top with a fresh strawberry slice or sprinkles!

## Tips & Notes

- For the strawberry puree, blend fresh or frozen strawberries until smooth, then strain to remove seeds.
- These cupcakes are best enjoyed within 2-3 days. Store in an airtight container.
- For extra strawberry flavor, add ½ tsp strawberry extract to the frosting.
- Make them extra special with edible glitter or pearl sprinkles on top!

## Storage

Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 5 days. Bring to room temperature before serving.
