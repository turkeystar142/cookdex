## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** - Preheat oven to 350°F while you sauté the fillings.

3. **Assemble the enchiladas** - Fill each tortilla with the chicken mixture, roll up, and line them up in a greased Pyrex or baking pan.

4. **Add sauce and cheese** - Pour enchilada sauce over the rolled tortillas and sprinkle with cheese.

5. **Bake** - Bake until the cheese is melted and crispy, about 25-30 minutes.
