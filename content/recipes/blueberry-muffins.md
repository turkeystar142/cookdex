## Ingredients

### For the Muffins
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ cup unsalted butter, melted
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- ½ cup milk
- 2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries

### For the Streusel Topping
- ¼ cup all-purpose flour
- ¼ cup granulated sugar
- 2 tbsp cold butter, cubed
- ½ tsp cinnamon

## Instructions

### Making the Streusel

1. In a small bowl, combine flour, sugar, and cinnamon.
2. Cut in cold butter with a fork or your fingers until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
3. Set aside.

### Making the Muffins

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C). Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners.

2. In a large bowl, whisk together flour, baking powder, and salt.

3. In another bowl, whisk together melted butter and sugar until combined.

4. Add eggs and vanilla to the butter mixture, whisking until smooth.

5. Add milk and mix until combined.

6. Pour wet ingredients into dry ingredients and stir until just combined. Don't overmix!

7. Gently fold in blueberries. If using frozen berries, don't thaw them first.

8. Divide batter evenly among muffin cups, filling each about ¾ full.

9. Sprinkle streusel topping generously over each muffin.

10. Bake for 22-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean and the tops are golden.

11. Let cool in pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.

## Tips & Tricks

- **Prevent sinking berries**: Toss blueberries in 1 tablespoon of flour before folding into batter.
- **For taller muffin tops**: Fill muffin cups all the way to the top and bake at 425°F for 5 minutes, then reduce to 375°F for the remaining time.
- **Lemon twist**: Add 1 tablespoon lemon zest to the batter for lemon blueberry muffins.
- **Extra moisture**: Replace ¼ cup of milk with sour cream or Greek yogurt.

## Storage

Store in an airtight container at room temperature for 2-3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
