Flaky and buttery pie crust that's perfect for any pie.

## Ingredients

- 1 1/4 cup flour
- 1/4 tablespoon sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 lb butter (cold, cubed)
- 3 1/2 tablespoons ice water

## Instructions

2. **Preheat** - Set the oven to preheat at a low temperature of 250°F.

2. **Pulse dry ingredients and butter** - In a food processor, pulse the flour, sugar, salt, and cold cubed butter until pea-sized pieces form.

3. **Add water** - Slowly add ice water and pulse until the dough comes together.

4. **Form and roll** - Form into a ball and roll out on a floured surface.

5. **Size and Cut** - Size, cut and fit the raw pie crust into your baking pan of choice.

6. **Pre-Bake** - Bake the pie crust for about 20 minutes to set it in the pan. It's now ready to be filled.

## Tips

- Keep the butter cold for the flakiest crust.
- Don't overwork the dough.
- Chill the dough for 30 minutes before rolling, if time permits.
