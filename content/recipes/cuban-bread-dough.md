Traditional Cuban bread dough with a crispy crust.

## Ingredients

### Starter (leave overnight in fridge)
- 1/2 teaspoon active yeast
- 1/2 cup warm water
- 1/2 cup flour

### Dough
- 1 package active yeast
- 2 teaspoons white sugar
- 3/4 cup warm water
- 3 tablespoons lard/shortening
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 3 cups flour
- 1 tablespoon cornmeal
- 1 teaspoon water for spray

## Instructions

1. **Make the starter overnight** - The night before, mix 1/2 teaspoon yeast, 1/2 cup warm water, and 1/2 cup flour. Cover and refrigerate 12 hours.

2. **Make the dough** - In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast and sugar in warm water. Add the starter, lard, salt, and flour. Mix until a dough forms.

3. **Knead** - Knead for 10 minutes until smooth and elastic.

4. **First rise** - Let rise in a lard-greased bowl until doubled, about 1-2 hours.

5. **Shape** - Punch down and shape into 2 loaves. Place on a baking sheet sprinkled with cornmeal.

6. **Second rise** - Let rise for 30-45 minutes.

7. **Bake** - Spray with water and bake at 375°F for 30-40 minutes until golden and hollow-sounding when tapped.

## Tips

- The starter adds depth of flavor to the bread.
- Spray with water during baking for a crispier crust.
- Great for Cuban sandwiches.
