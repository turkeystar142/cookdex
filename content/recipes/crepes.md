Thin and delicate crepes perfect for sweet or savory fillings.

## Ingredients

- 1 cup flour
- 1 1/2 cups milk
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 teaspoon salt

## Instructions

1. **Mix the batter** - Mix the flour, milk, and eggs until smooth. Add the salt.

2. **Heat the pan** - Lightly grease a pan and place over medium-low heat.

3. **Cook** - Pour enough batter to make a circle half the size of the pan and tilt the pan to spread the batter thin.

4. **Flip** - Cook on one side until edges are golden. Flip to give some golden color to the other side.

5. **Fill and serve** - Remove and add filling/toppings.

## Tips

- Let the batter rest for 30 minutes for even better results.
- Use a non-stick pan for easiest cooking.
- Fill with Nutella, fruit, whipped cream, ham and cheese, or any filling you like.
