A moist and delicious banana bread recipe that's perfect for using up overripe bananas.

## Ingredients

### Dry Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon

### Wet Ingredients
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 3-4 ripe bananas, mashed (about 1 1/2 cups)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

### Optional Add-ins
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts or pecans
- 1/2 cup chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Preheat the oven** to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan or line it with parchment paper.

2. **Mix dry ingredients** - In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon. Set aside.

3. **Combine wet ingredients** - In another bowl, mix the melted butter and sugar until well combined. Add the beaten eggs, mashed bananas, and vanilla extract. Stir until smooth.

4. **Combine wet and dry** - Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients. Gently fold together until just combined. Don't overmix - a few lumps are okay.

5. **Add optional ingredients** - If using nuts or chocolate chips, fold them in now.

6. **Bake** - Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan. Bake for 60-65 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.

7. **Cool** - Let the bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips

- The riper the bananas, the better! Look for bananas with lots of brown spots.
- Don't overmix the batter - this can make the bread tough.
- If the top is browning too quickly, tent it with aluminum foil during the last 15 minutes of baking.
- Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.
