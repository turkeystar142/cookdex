Simple handmade pasta using a 1:1 ratio of flour to eggs.

## Ingredients

- 100 g flour : 1 egg (repeat ratio as needed)

## Instructions

1. **Make a well** - On a clean surface, place flour in a mound and make a divot in the center.

2. **Add egg** - Add egg to the divot. Slowly beat the egg while incorporating flour from the sides.

3. **Knead** - When it clumps, knead by hand for 10 minutes until smooth with bounce.

4. **Rest** - Rest for 30 minutes. Knead for 2 minutes. Rest 10 more minutes.

5. **Roll** - Roll thin enough to see light through it.

6. **Cut** - Cut into desired shapes (noodles, squares for bows or ravioli, etc.).

## Tips

- The dough should be smooth and elastic after kneading.
- Don't skip the resting time - it makes the dough easier to roll.
- Fresh pasta cooks much faster than dried pasta.
