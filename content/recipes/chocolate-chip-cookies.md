## Ingredients

- 2¼ cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) butter, softened
- ¾ cup granulated sugar
- ¾ cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips (semi-sweet or milk chocolate)
- Optional: 1 cup chopped walnuts or pecans

## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. In a small bowl, combine flour, baking soda, and salt. Set aside.

3. In a large bowl, beat softened butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until creamy and smooth.

4. Add eggs and vanilla extract to the butter mixture. Beat until well combined.

5. Gradually add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, stirring until just combined. Don't overmix!

6. Fold in chocolate chips (and nuts if using).

7. Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto ungreased cookie sheets, spacing them about 2 inches apart.

8. Bake for 9-12 minutes, or until golden brown around the edges. The centers should still look slightly underbaked.

9. Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.

## Tips for Perfect Cookies

- **Don't overbake!** Cookies continue cooking after you remove them from the oven. Take them out when they look slightly underdone for the softest texture.
- **Chill the dough** for 30 minutes before baking for thicker cookies.
- **Use room temperature butter** for the best texture.
- **Add a pinch of sea salt** on top before baking for a gourmet touch.

## Variations

- **Double Chocolate**: Add ¼ cup cocoa powder to the flour mixture and reduce flour by ¼ cup.
- **White Chocolate Macadamia**: Use white chocolate chips and add 1 cup chopped macadamia nuts.
- **Peanut Butter**: Add ½ cup peanut butter to the wet ingredients.

## Storage

Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week, or freeze for up to 3 months.
