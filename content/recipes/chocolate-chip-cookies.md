Classic chocolate chip cookies that are crispy on the edges and soft in the center.

## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup butter (soft, salted)
- 1/2 cup white sugar
- 1/2 cup light brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla
- 1 egg
- 1 1/2 cups flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/3 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1 cup chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Cream butter and sugars** - Beat the soft butter, white sugar, and brown sugar together until fluffy. Add the egg and mix well.

2. **Add dry ingredients** - Mix in the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt until just combined.

3. **Add vanilla and chocolate chips** - Stir in the vanilla and chocolate chips.

4. **Bake** - Drop spoonfuls of dough onto a baking sheet. Bake at 375°F for 8-10 minutes until golden.

## Tips

- Don't overbake - they should look slightly underdone when you remove them.
- Let cookies cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack.
- Store in an airtight container for up to 1 week.
