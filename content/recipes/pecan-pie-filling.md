## Ingredients

- 5 tablespoons unsalted butter
- 1 cup light brown sugar (packed)
- 3/4 cup light corn syrup
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 2 cups chopped, toasted pecans
- 2 tablespoons liquor (bourbon, whiskey, scotch)
- 2 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 3 eggs, lightly beaten

## Instructions

1. **Make the filling base** - In a medium saucepan, combine butter, brown sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Boil over medium heat, stirring constantly. Boil for 1 minute.

2. **Add nuts and flavorings** - Remove from heat and stir in nuts, vanilla, and bourbon. Allow to cool for 5 minutes.

3. **Prepare crust** - While making the filling, make sure your pie crust is baking.

4. **Add eggs** - Once filling has cooled for 5 minutes, whisk in the beaten eggs until smooth.

5. **Pour and bake** - Pour filling into hot crust. Bake at 350°F for about 40 minutes, until sides are firm and golden. The center can be soft.

6. **Cool and serve** - Take out and serve with ice cream after cooling.

## Tips

- Toast the pecans beforehand for extra flavor.
- The center should still have a slight jiggle when done.
- Store covered at room temperature for up to 2 days, or refrigerate for up to 5 days.
