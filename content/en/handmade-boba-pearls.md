## Ingredients

- 89 g tapioca starch
- 1 g dry colorant (ultra dark black cocoa preferred)
- 15 g white sugar
- 3 tablespoons boiling water

## Instructions

1. **Mix dry ingredients** - In a bowl, mix the tapioca starch, colorant, and sugar.

2. **Add boiling water** - Ensure water is boiling hot. Add all 3 tablespoons at once.

3. **Mix quickly** - Quickly mix and press with a spatula until one mass forms (it won't look smooth yet).

4. **Knead** - Knead on a floured surface until it resembles playdough.

5. **Roll into pearls** - Break off small pieces and roll into balls.

6. **Cook** - Boil for 20 minutes, then turn off heat and let rest for 20 minutes.

## Tips

- The water must be boiling hot for the starch to properly gelatinize.
- Work quickly after adding the water.
- Store cooked boba in simple syrup to keep them from drying out.
