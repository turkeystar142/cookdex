## Ingredients

### Dough
- 1 cup gluten-free flour
- 1 cup plain Greek yogurt
- 2 teaspoons baking powder

### Egg Wash
- 1 egg yolk
- 1 tablespoon water (approximate, to thin the wash)

### Optional Toppings

- Sesame seeds
- Cinnamon Sugar

## Instructions

1. **Mix the dough** - In a bowl, combine the gluten-free flour, Greek yogurt, and baking powder. Mix until combined.

2. **Knead and divide** - Knead the mixture into a ball. Cut the dough into 4 equal pieces.

3. **Shape the bagels** - Roll each piece into a rope and form into a bagel shape, sealing the ends.

4. **Prepare egg wash** - In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and a small amount of water.

5. **Top the bagels** - Brush each bagel with egg wash and sprinkle desired seasoning on top.

6. **Air fry option** - Place bagels in the air fryer on the bake setting at 350°F for 8–10 minutes, or until golden brown.

7. **Oven option** - If baking in a conventional oven, bake at 375°F for 20–25 minutes, or until cooked through and golden.

## Notes

- Cooking time may vary slightly depending on your air fryer or oven.
- Allow bagels to cool slightly before slicing.
- Top with your favorite cream cheese spread or butter and jam.
